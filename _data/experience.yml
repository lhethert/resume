    CSIRO's Analytics & Decision Sciences (A&DS) program use machine learning, data analytics, optimisation and computational modelling to develop decision support technology in a wide range of application domains, such as natural hazards and infrastructure, comminution, human performance and industrial transformation.
    I have two primary roles in the program: a senior technical lead for the program’s publicly available, cross-platform scientific application development framework, [Workspace](https://research.csiro.au/workspace); and leader of the program’s Industrial Transformation initiative. My key achievements include:
    -	Visualisation lead on the program’s largest commercial project, iteratively delivered over several years to a large manufacturing company in the USA. My responsibilities include requirements gathering and designing and implementing solutions (<mark>C++</mark> / <mark>Qt</mark> / <mark>OpenGL</mark> / <mark>HDF5</mark>) to handle the enormous point-cloud datasets generated by our distributed sensor fusion platform. This requires providing regular on-site support at customer sites in the US. Our local lab was [opened publicly](https://data61.csiro.au/en/Our-Research/Programs-and-Facilities/Labs-and-Facilities/Mixed-Reality-Lab) in 2019 to generate opportunities with local industrial organisations.
    -	Lead engineer on the Workspace-based [Fractura project](https://research.csiro.au/fractura), a modelling platform for Hydraulic Fracturing research. I am responsible for defining the technical architecture of the project, leading interactions with the client, implementing major architectural features (<mark>C++</mark> / <mark>Qt</mark> / <mark>SQL</mark>) and managing a team of developers.
    -	Leader of the Industrial Transformation initiative in the A&DS program, with responsibility for strategic leadership of the research agenda, engaging externally to generate interest, and ensuring staff are collectively pursuing revenue earning opportunities, exceeding the Initiative’s external earnings target.
    -	Presenting Workspace solutions at multiple conferences and customer sites globally, in many cases running interactive customer workshops. These engagements frequently result in new third-party projects such as [Heliosim](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5067213), [GrainScan](https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-4811-10-23) and [SpotSizer](https://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.2144/000114459).

    Prior to becoming a senior engineer, I was working within the Computational Modelling & Simulation group as a software engineer specialising in 3D rendering and visualisation. My key achievements during this period were:
    -	Lead designer and developer of the 3D rendering engine deployed in [Workspace](https://research.csiro.au/workspace). Built using <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>OpenGL</mark> and <mark>Qt</mark>, it is core to much of the software published by the group. Features include a pluggable shader architecture, volume rendering, and huge (100 million+ points) point cloud visualisation.
    -	Lead software engineer on the Workspace-based [Spark](https://research.csiro.au/spark) and [Swift](https://research.csiro.au/swift) projects, working with researchers in the Natural Hazards team in the development of their state-of-the-art fire and flood modelling platforms. I ran successful requirements gathering and user training workshops with their first customers, helping the team to grow into a large, successful research group in its own right.
    -	Designed and developed a [Python API](https://github.com/csiro-workspace/workspace-python) for interacting with Workspace workflows out-of-process. The API was deployed in a web application with a <mark>Javascript</mark> (<mark>Angular</mark>) front-end.
    -	Initiated and led many Workspace-based projects with research and commercial customers around Australia, taking responsibility for product design, planning and delivery.

    Accenture is a large, multinational consulting firm that develops solutions for large enterprise companies. I worked with a small team of software developers to build a web-based product configuration application, which was used to capture, format and push the customer’s product data to multiple downstream applications. Key achievements include:
    -	Successful design, development and delivery of a complex .NET based web application (C#, VB, ASP.NET, WCF), the key features of which were complex version control, release management and a flexible product designer sandbox.
    -	Developed a C# / COM application to read existing product models and render them as high-level designs in Microsoft Visio documents.
    -	Successfully ran requirements gathering and design workshops with both internal and external stakeholders.
